<h1>Hi there, this is Chuhuan Huang 黄楚焕</h1>
<p>I am a first-year PhD student in Mathematics @ Johns Hopkins University, advised by Professor Fei Lu.</p>
<p>  My research interests range from probability theory&applications, long time series modeling, and reinforcement learning theory&algorithms&applications. (Of course I am open to new and exciting things! Recently the amazing applications of LLMs really inspired me.) </p>

<p>I finished my B.S. in Mathematics-Computer Scienece @ University of California, San Diego, and my M.A. in Applied Mathematics 
  @ University of Southern California, under the supervision of Professor Steven Heilman, Professor Jianfeng Zhang, 
  and Professor Remigijus Mikulevicius, with a <a href="https://chh172.github.io/cv/paper.pdf">thesis</a> "A Survey on the Computational Hardness of Linear-Structured Markov Decision Processes". </p>
  <p>Feel free to reach me out thru chuan129(at)jh(dot)edu.</p>
