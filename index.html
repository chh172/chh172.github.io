<h1>Hi there, this is Chuhuan Huang 黄楚焕</h1>
<p>I am an incoming PhD student in Mathematics @ Johns Hopkins University.</p> 
<p>  My research interests range from probability theory&applications, reinforcement learning theory&algorithms&applications, 
  mathematical data science to mathematical game theory (Of course I am open to new and exciting things! Recently I am very excited in LLMs.). </p>

<p>I finished my B.S. in Mathematics-Computer Scienece @ University of California, San Diego, and about to finish my M.A. in Applied Mathematics 
  @ University of Southern California, under the supervision of Professor Steven Heilman, Professor Jianfeng Zhang, 
  and Professor Remigijus Mikulevicius, with a thesis "A Survey on the Computational Hardness of Linear-Structured Markov Decision Processes". </p>
